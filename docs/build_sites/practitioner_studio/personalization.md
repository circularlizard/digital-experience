# Personalization

Learn how to configure your HCL Digital Experience portal site as an Administrator.

## Overview

Personalization allows a Portal Administrator to configure the site so that different content appears for site visitors based upon their attributes. For example, a site that uses Personalization can show different news articles to managers than to regular employees, or different information to valued customers.

If you choose to not enable Practitioner Studio, you can still manage Personalization using the Application navigation menu in the toolbar.
