# Web Content Library


To get started, explore the different areas of HCL Web Content Manager.

1.  [Create a content library](oob_content_createlib.md)  
 You use the Administration portlets to create libraries. You can have multiple content libraries. To determine how many libraries you need, consider the type of site you are developing and who needs access to certain content. A minimum of two libraries is common. You can set up one library to store items required for the web content system and another library for content.
2.  [Set up access to libraries](oob_content_accesslib.md)  
You have a number of ways to grant and restrict access to libraries. There are five content user roles: User, Contributor, Editor, Manager, and Administrator. Each role has specific access rights. You can associate individual users or groups of users with a role. There are three levels that you can assign access to: library, item type per library, and item level.
3.  [Set up the authoring experience](oob_content_auth.md)  
 HCL Web Content Manager includes a number of authoring user interface options. After the installation, the library explorer is the selected use interface. The provided options help you quickly get started. 
4.  [Managing web content libraries](../web_content_library/manage_web_content_lib/index.md)  
As an administrator you need to periodically assist content managers with library maintenance, such as disabling or deleting a library.
