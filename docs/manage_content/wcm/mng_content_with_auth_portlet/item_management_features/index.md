# Item management features

Web Content Manager includes a range of features that help you manage the web content items that are used in your system.

-   **[Web content folders](wcm_dev_folders.md)**  
You use folders to group sets of web content item types into logical groupings.
-   **[Locked and draft items](wcm_managing_item_locks.md)**  
As you collaborate with other users, you might encounter items that are locked because they are being edited by another user or because a draft item has been created.
-   **[How to manage versions of items](wcm_managing_versions.md)**  
You can configure your system to either automatically save a version of an item each time it is published, or allow users to select when to save a version of an item. You can restore items individually, or choose to restore a set of items within a library that either have the same label or were versioned at, or before, a specified date and time.
-   **[How to delete items](wcm_managing_deleting.md)**  
You cannot always immediately delete items. Sometimes you need to take steps to prepare an item for deletion.
-   **[Viewing references](wcm_managing_viewing_references.md)**  
You can view and manage all of the links between items by viewing references.
-   **[Managing references](wcm_managing_references.md)**  
When you delete items that are referenced by other items, you need to resolve any references that are broken by deleting the item. A dialog opens listing the items that cannot be deleted.
-   **[How to manage authoring templates](../item_management_features/howto_manage_auth_templates/index.md)**  
From time to time, you might need to reapply or change the authoring templates that are assigned to a set of items.
-   **[How to manage a taxonomy](../item_management_features/howto_manage_taxonomy/index.md)**  
From time to time, you need to edit the structure of a taxonomy.
-   **[How to move, copy, or link items](../item_management_features/howto_move_copy_link_items/index.md)**  
From time to time, you need to move, copy, or link items.
-   **[How to work with draft items](wcm_dev_drafts.md)**  
Creating a draft of an item allows users to work on changes to that item without changing the published version of the item. Draft items can either be stand-alone items, or form part of a workflow. When the changes are completed, you can choose to either publish the item, or discard the changes by canceling the draft. You can create multiple drafts of a single item.
-   **[How to manage expired items](wcm_dev_expired_items.md)**  
Expired items are items that were published but then removed from the live website. Only items that use a workflow can be expired.
-   **[How to manage published items](wcm_dev_published_items.md)**  
Items are not visible on a website until they are published. When published, an item can be expired, or returned to a draft state.
-   **[Removing and adding workflows](wcm_managing_workflows_remove.md)**  
The process of adding and removing workflows on items is determined by the type of item that is being edited, and your level of access.
-   **[Restoring an item](wcm_managing_versions_working.md)**  
Previous versions of items can be stored and then restored later if required.
-   **[Editing user profiles](wcm_dev_profiling_users.md)**  
You can add profile information to users. User profiles can be used as search parameters in menus.
-   **[Batch-editing access controls](wcm_security_items_batch-edit.md)**  
An administrator can apply access control settings for multiple items.
