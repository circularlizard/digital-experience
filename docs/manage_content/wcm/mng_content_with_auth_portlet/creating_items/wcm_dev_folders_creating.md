# Creating a folder


You create a folder when you need to store a set of the same type of items in a logical grouping.

To create a folder, open the applications menu and go to **Content > Web Content Management** and then click **New > Folder**.

1.  [Entering identification information](wcm_dev_items_id.md)  
Specify identification information for the current item, including the name and title for the item. The identification section is common to all item forms.
2.  [Specifying a location for an item](wcm_dev_items_location.md)  
When you create an item, you can specify the location of the item.
3.  [Granting users or groups access to an item](wcm_dev_items_access.md)  
Specify the access control settings for the current item to designate which users have access to an item and their level of access. The access section is common to all item forms.
