# Web content inline editing strategies

An inline editing system is used to deliver editable websites such as an intranet or a wiki. It combines the features of both an authoring system and a delivery system.

-   **[Inline editing](../wcm_inline_editing/inline_editing/index.md)**  
Inline editing enables users with edit access to a content item to edit that item from within the web page itself instead of using the authoring portlet. This feature is available when you display content with a web content viewer portlet.
-   **[Creating an authoring tools element](../../wcm_artifacts/elements/howto_work_with_elements/authoringtools_element/index.md)**  
The authoring tool element is used to add authoring portlet functions to web pages. When you create an authoring tool element, you need to define the layout of the authoring tool and any required actions, and select parameters for each action layout as required.
