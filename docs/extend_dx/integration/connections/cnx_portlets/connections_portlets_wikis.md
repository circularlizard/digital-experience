# The Wikis portlet

The IBM® Connections Wikis portlet brings the collaborative power of an IBM Connections wiki to IBM WebSphere® Portal.

## Using the Wikis portlet

Use the Wikis portlet to interact with the IBM Connections Wikis feature so you can access content without leaving the IBM WebSphere Portal environment.

## Editing the shared settings for the Wikis portlet

You must have at least editor access for the page and for the portlet to be able to edit shared settings for Connections features. For more information about access levels, see the WebSphere Portal product wiki. Settings you enter on this page can be overridden by settings on the **Personalize** page for a portlet. Choose**Edit Shared Settings** from the portlet menu and choose which view to display in the portlet. You can choose to display:

-   All wikis
-   A list of all wiki pages for this community \(default\)
-   The currently selected wiki page
-   The most recent wiki page for this community

!!! tip
    If your site has a large number of wikis, use the Tags portlet to find wikis that interest you. You can also edit a wiki and then access it by sorting by recently updated wikis.

## Configuring the Wikis portlet
