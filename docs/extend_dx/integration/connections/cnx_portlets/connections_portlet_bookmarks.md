# The Bookmarks portlet

The IBM® Connections Bookmarks portlet gives you access to your bookmarks from within IBM WebSphere® Portal.

## Using the Bookmarks portlet

use the Bookmarks portlet to access your IBM Connections bookmarks without leaving the IBM WebSphere Portal environment. The portlet has two views, **All Bookmarks** and **My Bookmarks**.

The **All Bookmarks** view displays bookmarks you created as well as bookmarks shared with you by others in your organization. The **My Bookmarks** view displays only the bookmarks that you created. You can click the **More** option for a bookmark to edit or delete it.

From the **All Bookmarks** or the **My Bookmarks** view you can:

-   Click a bookmark to visit the web page.
-   Click **More** to view details about the bookmark.
-   Click the name of a bookmark owner to view the associated business card.
-   Sort the view by clicking the column header for **Date** or by **Popularity**.

The **My Blogs** view lists blogs for which you are an owner or member. From this view, you can:

-   Click the name of a blog to open it. You can view the entries and comments or create an entry.
-   Click the name of an Ideation Blog to open it so that you can view the ideas and view voting activity.
-   Click **Settings** to edit the basics for a blog, including the title, description, and tags. You can also add blog owners, authors, or draft users.
-   Click **Start a Blog** to start a new blog.

    !!! note
        You cannot create an Ideation Blog from the Blogs portlet because it must be created within a community.
