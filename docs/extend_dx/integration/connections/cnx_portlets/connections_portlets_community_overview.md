# The Community Overview portlet

Use the Community Overview portlet to display information from an IBM® Connections community in an IBM WebSphere® Portal application.

## Using the Community Overview portlet

Use the Community Overview portlet to display any of the following information from an IBM Community:

-   Community icon
-   Community name
-   Community owners
-   Tags
-   Community description
-   Community Type

A portlet page that contains a community overview portlet has membership that is scoped to the community membership. If you leave the community, you no longer have access to the portal page and are taken to the home page for the portal application.

## Editing the shared settings for the Community Overview portlet

You must have at least editor access for the page and for the portlet to be able to edit shared settings for Connections features. For more information about access levels, see the WebSphere Portal product wiki. Settings you enter on this page can be overridden by settings on the **Personalize** page for a portlet. Choose**Edit Shared Settings** from the portlet menu and choose which information from the community you want to display in the portlet.
